  abstract     = {Strongly disordered pseudogapped superconductors are expected to display arbitrary high values of kinetic inductance close to superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) that makes them attractive for the implementation of dissipationless superinductance. We develop the theory of the collective modes in these superconductors and discuss associated dissipation at microwave frequencies. We obtain the collective mode spectra dependence on the disorder level and conclude that collective modes become relevant source of dissipation and noise in the far vicinity of SIT.},

  year         = {2010},
  abstract     = {We develop a semi-quantitative theory of electron pairing and resulting superconductivity in bulk "poor conductors" in which Fermi energy $E_F$ is located in the region of localized states not so far from the Anderson mobility edge $E_c$. We review the existing theories and experimental data and argue that a large class of disordered films is described by this model. Our theoretical analysis is based on the analytical treatment of pairing correlations, described in the basis of the exact single-particle eigenstates of the 3D Anderson model, which we combine with numerical data on eigenfunction correlations. Fractal nature of critical wavefunction's correlations is shown to be crucial for the physics of these systems. We identify three distinct phases: 'critical' superconductive state formed at $E_F=E_c$, superconducting state with a strong pseudogap, realized due to pairing of weakly localized electrons and insulating state realized at $E_F$ still deeper inside localized band. The 'critical' superconducting phase is characterized by the enhancement of the transition temperature with respect to BCS result, by the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of superconductive order parameter and local density of states. The major new feature of the pseudo-gaped state is the presence of two independent energy scales: superconducting gap $\Delta$, that is due to many-body correlations and a new "pseudogap" energy scale $\Delta_P$ which characterizes typical binding energy of localized electron pairs and leads to the insulating behavior of the resistivity as a function of temperature above superconductive $T_c$. Two gap nature of the "pseudo-gaped superconductor" is shown to lead to a number of unusual physical properties.},

  abstract    = {In most superconductors the transition to the superconducting state is driven by the binding of electrons into Cooper-pairs. The condensation of these pairs into a single, phase coherent, quantum state takes place concomitantly with their formation at the transition temperature, $T_c$. A different scenario occurs in some disordered, amorphous, superconductors: Instead of a pairing-driven transition, incoherent Cooper pairs first pre-form above $T_c$, causing the opening of a pseudogap, and then, at $T_c$, condense into the phase coherent superconducting state. Such a two-step scenario implies the existence of a new energy scale, $\Delta_{c}$, driving the collective superconducting transition of the preformed pairs. Here we unveil this energy scale by means of Andreev spectroscopy in superconducting thin films of amorphous indium oxide. We observe two Andreev conductance peaks at $\pm \Delta_{c}$ that develop only below $T_c$ and for highly disordered films on the verge of the transition to insulator. Our findings demonstrate that amorphous superconducting films provide prototypical disordered quantum systems to explore the collective superfluid transition of preformed Cooper-pairs pairs.},
